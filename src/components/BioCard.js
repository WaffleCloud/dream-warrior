        Amituofo,
        my name is Christian Jimenez I am 37 years old and currently living in Venic CA. 
        Back in 2016 I was Living in brooklyn NY where I was pursuing my dream to become a Martial Arts actor. 
        I was learning  Shaolin Kung Fu  and in that school my Shifu would always start and end the class by saying Amituofo. 
        It is among many things the way we greet and say goodbye to each other.
        During My 6 years in New York I learned many lessons the biggest ones being “self sufficiency” and “perseverance”. 
        I learned to keep moving forward and to stay disciplined even when things weren’t always going my way…
        Around 2018 I went to China with a friend to study Shaolin Kung Fu at the kunming branch. 
        It was an awesome month long adventure! On the day before my flight back to the U.S.A I tried to practice a front flip with my fellow students and suffered an ankle injury, I had severely sprained it when I "landed"
        I remember hobbling everywhere after I got back it was painful in its limitations. 
        Even though I felt it healing the restrictions were apparent--
        I couldn't even walk fast! let alone jump, kick, or practice Kung Fu.
        My ankle eventually did get better but it took discipline to make sure I didnt spiral into a depression and give up. 
        I eventually went back to class and back to practicing Kung Fu. 
        Extremely lightly at first, and then slowly as I regained my stregth and confidence I was fully healed.
        After many ups and downs the pandemic hit and put everything on pause but as soon as it was ok I drove back to California so I could be closer to my family 
        So here I am in Los Angeles chasing my dream one kung fu kick at a time.
