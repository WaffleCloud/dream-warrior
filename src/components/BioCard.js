        Amituofo,<br/><br/>
        For six years I trained at the USA Shaolin temple in Brooklyn, NY.<br/><br/>
        My instructor was Shifu Shi Yan-Ming, a 34th generation Shaolin Temple Fighting Monk.<br/><br/>
        The biggest lesson I learned from Shifu is “self sufficiency and perseverance”. <br/><br/>
        Even when things aren't going my way, I keep moving forward and stay disciplined.<br/><br/>
        While training in China at the Shaolin Kung Fu kunming branch,<br/>
        I injured my ankle practicing front flips.<br/>
        I couldn't even walk fast! Let alone jump, kick, or practice Kung Fu.<br/><br/>
        This did not stop me!<br/><br/>
        Utilizing my practice of self-discipline, I maintained a positive attitue and <br/>
        remained tenaciously focused on my goals.<br/><br/>
        Regardless of what life throws at me, be it a pandemic, injuries, financial setbacks, bad weather...<br/><br/>
        I remain on my path, steadfast, consistent, and determined.<br/><br/>
        Train harder! More Chi!<br/>
